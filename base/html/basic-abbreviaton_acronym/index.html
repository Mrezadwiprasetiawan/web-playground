    <!--The <abbr> HTML element represents an abbreviation or acronym.

      When including an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term
      in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> to mark up the abbreviation. 
      This informs the user what the abbreviation or acronym means.
      The optional title attribute can provide an expansion for the abbreviation or
      acronym when a full expansion is not present. This provides a hint to user
      agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the
      abbreviation means. If present, title must contain this full description and
      nothing else.-->
